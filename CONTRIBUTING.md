# Contributing to Roadie OSS

We support the Backstage sponsors, maintainers and community in their vision for Backstage to become the trusted standard toolbox (read: UX layer) for the open source infrastructure landscape. We realize this is an ambitious goal. We can‚Äôt do it alone.

Therefore we want to create strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that Backstage deserves.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Unless otherwise specified, our open-source code is released under the Apache 2.0 License, and original creations contributed to our repos are accepted under the same license.

We aim to stick as closely as possible to the [contribution guidelines which apply to the Backstage project](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). If something is not covered in this document, please assume that the appropriate Backstage guideline will apply. 

## Types of Contributions

### Report bugs

No one likes bugs. Report bugs as a GitHub issue.

### Fix bugs or build new features

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs or problems that other users are having. If you're having a problem yourself, feel free to contribute a fix for review.

### Submit feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file a GitHub issue.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Explain the wider context about what you are trying to achieve.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)
